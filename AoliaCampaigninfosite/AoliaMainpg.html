		<h1>Aolia Campaign Info Site</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my Campaign site for the world of Aolia, This is my first foray into web 				developement so please bear with the unasthetic nature of all of this as I get acquainted with it 			all. Now I am still trying to figure out how to host this site on my raspberry pi, so for the time 		being I will be sending you all this site as a file directory until I figure it out. A readme is 			included with the first launch of this site, so if your reading this I assume you have read the 			readme and understood how to launch the site and navigate it from your browser of choice. Now feel 		free to explore the site and what it has to offer, keep in mind this is a work in progress and 		some areas that the buttons lead to may not be finished yet.</p>
