		<p><b>Ardvaste Kilvastre:</b><br />Ardvaste Kylvastre was born to a relatively well-to-do family in Eflary. Not nobility, but rich and somewhat powerful, whose name may hold small sway in Eflary were he not disowned. They run a guild of jewelers within the city, specializing in ancient or otherwise old jewelry. 
As a young man, he loved song and music, and was shown to be musically inclined. His parents never much cared for it, but were willing at least to send him to the College of Fochlucan (fok-lu-kan), among the best money could buy in Opriera, where he mostly grew up.While there, he met three of his greatest friends and allies. Aldonis, a drow studying in the College of Valor, Frada, a halfling woman who would become his criminal contact, and his favorite professor, an elderly Dwarven woman named Professor Umbara Umethra.Aldonis eventually sold his services to Agros to help curb their native populations, and lost his life in the service. Ardvaste still has the necklace Aldonis gave him before he left, and considers it his most prized possession. He was often looked at strangely for choosing to make friends with a Drow, but it was there he came into the worship of Ilestrie.Frada dropped out of school, but she was the one who taught Ardvaste all about the thief trade. She taught him how to pick locks and pockets, how to swindle people with his words and even his trademark "Tarot Scheme." She is his criminal contact, still operating within Opriera.Being very studious, Ardvaste wound up working himself sick, forgetting to eat or sleep. Professor Umethra took him on a field trip to the beach to help him recover. He developed a deep love of beach and coast, basing several songs on the sounds and words he heard while he was there. Even when he came back, he found himself dreaming of the ocean waves and sea air. Upon his return to Eflary, he managed to earn the right to perform at a party being held by the Eflary nobility. After his performance, while eating, he wound up flirting with a rather beautiful young woman, and ended up seducing her. He had been away long enough that he hadn't realized it was the Princess, and had wound up sleeping with her in the King and Queen's room. He wound up being caught by said King and Queen and put to trial. He was able to win his innocence by proving his ignorance, and wound up being acquitted. His parents, however, disowned him and told him to leave, a request he complied with, and has refused to see them since. After that, he traveled wherever he could, stealing, playing, sleeping around, scamming and learning any story or song he could get his hands on. Until he finds the party, going by the name of Ardvaste Lilyblossom or the stage name Love's Vagrant.</p>

		<p><b>Felan from Da Woods:</b><br />Laserie Ellas Gylle is the name she was given by her mother, Ilias Arwelyel  a Wood Elf and her father, Maysem Gylle a Human. He was a baker and she was a huntress who happened to frequent his shop. One thing led to another and the two fell in love and got married.However, before all of that happened between those two, Ardvaste Kylvastre had known Ilias. They had been dating for a while but she broke up with him because she had taken interest in Maysem instead. They still stayed in contact and was invited to their wedding at which he played music. Once Ilias and Maysem found out she was pregnant, the new spread to Ardvaste and he has pretty happy about it. He wished the couple well and gave the suggestion for a name of the child to be born. It was a girl’s name, Laserie meaning surrounded by love.  While Ilias was still pregnant, He popped by to visit for a while and left a music box (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIwyIM2WYAk) as a present for the baby.
 
 They were pretty happy until the winter that Laserie was born. There weren’t any complications, but Ilias was left very, very weak after giving birth and got very ill. She passed in the middle of spring that year. Maysem did the best that he could to keep things going. But it was very tough for just a baker. With all of the dealings and stresses of losing his wife, raising a small child that needed constant supervision, and trying to keep the shop afloat, he started drinking….
 
Maysem started losing business due to competition so he started gambling to balance out what he was losing. He had good intentions with his earnings, like buying new clothes for Laserie and to buy flowers for Illias…. However, he got into a lot of debt and the drinking got worse. He would drink to forget his regrets and shortcomings as a husband, a baker and a father. He struggled in teaching and talking to Laserie because of her eyes. They were green and bright with wonder and curiosity, just like her mother’s…… For Laserie’s first birthday, she and her father evicted from their house and all of their belongings including the bakery was seized due to outstanding debts. The only things they had were clothes on their backs, some furs, bread to last a while, and a knotted leather choker with a green glass bead in the middle that belonged to the late Ilias. That necklace was the last thing that Ilias has made for her child before she had passed. Maysem, holding his sleeping child and looked to her with a sad smile as he swept a few hairs away from her face. He carefully slipped the leather choker (which was more like a necklace) over Laserie’s head for her to wear it. He wished her a happy birthday and apologized after…. For a couple of weeks, those two lived in the gutter begging for food, clothing, and whatever anyone could spare. At this point, Maysem was a broken man.. In losing everything he became numb to everything, including his daughter and had started to neglect her completely…. 
At 14 months (a year and 2 months), Laserie could stand, but not quite walk yet. She could tell you no, she knew how to call for her dad, and she could tell you when she was hungry. When she wanted attention. She would call for her dad to look at her or to feed her and it was always a struggle to get a response. He rarely did anything if she started to cry.
Driven by pangs of hunger, and the need for someone to acknowledge her she wandered out, seeking food and somewhere warm on a very cold winter day. Her father didn’t even notice that she was gone. 
Laserie crawled pretty far from the area before the cold from the snow and hunger really started getting to her. She was at the edge of town, right on the edge of the forest when she had stopped. Not knowing what else to do, she cried for anyone to help her before the cold did. She cried until she couldn’t anymore, until she passed out from well, everything. 
Back in Maysem’s gutter, a familiar face stumbled upon him. Ardvaste, had come to pay the family a visit but he had no idea what had gone on in the last year. He demanded to know what happened and where the baby was. Maysem hardly gave a response so Ardavast pretty much beat the shit out of him for abandoning the child, left him that the doorstep of a church and went off to try to look for the baby.
Laserie woke up a few hours later in a dark, but very warm place. As she reached out in front and beside her she felt very fine and soft brush it was warm and comforting to her. Laserie, got comfortable once again and fell back asleep.
 She was brought back from her sleep with unfamiliar movement and sounds. After a shift, she could feel something cold and wet on her cheek. As she moves a hand to feel what was going on, her green eyes met with a pair of dark brown ones. She blinked before smiling and reaching out to them with her little hands. They self something cold and wet, the same sensation as her cheek. As her hand was nudged away, Laserie tried to put together what was in front of her. It wasn’t like anything she had ever seen before. A creature with a fluffy underbelly but coarse coat everywhere else, a slim snout that opened up to a face with two slender brown eyes and what could be ears at the top of it’s head. She couldn’t see its colors too well because the sun’s light has started to fade for the day.. She was curious, but had more important things to worry about. Laserie looked to her stomach as it started to rumble. Her gaze shifted to the creature in front of her as tears were starting to well up in her eyes. The beast she was lounging on tilted its head up slightly for a moment before reaching its head out of Laserie’s view for a moment. It turned back to her chewing for a moment and then it nudged her forehead with the tip of it’s nose. She cooed as she grabbed the creature’s muzzle to have it reveal food! Laserie took a big fistful and shoved it straight into her mouth. As she ate, the creature had decided that it would take this abandoned pup under it’s care.
((So… In realized that this was starting to get really long and I still had more to cover, so I’ll start shortening this up a bit!))
Nene was the name of the older wolf that took Laserie in and she took care of her, named her “Felan” or small wolf , and taught her the ways of being a wolf up until Laserie was about 3. Around that time, she was introduced to Nene’s youngest daughter Onai and her mate Raff. Nene died a little after, leaving Felan in in her daughter’s care. Felan kept a claw and a canine from Nene.
The spring after Felan turned 4, she was playing around with her parents when her legs got caught in an abandoned bear trap. Raff stayed with her as Onai went in search of help. Luckily, she was pretty familiar with a druid the lived in their forest, Arien Londe so she sought after him. Onai returned a few hours later with the druid and he freed Felan from the trap. Her wounds were terrible and she had lost a lot of blood. After administering first aid, he took Felan to his hut to tend to her wounds. Onai and Raff allowed this because they trusted the druid. They still came with though!
Because she was young natural medicine and herbs were used in place of magic. It would take longer to heal, but it would be better for her. To make sure that her legs worked properly, she was taught to walk upright. At this point, the druid had taken a liking to Felan because she showed promise.  He taught her a few words and introduced her to “clothing”  before sending her off to her parents that had just had pups! Their names were Edon (male) , Vilkas (male) , and Chann (female)
As the years passed, Felan probably six years old,  frequented Arien’s hut and began to grow more interested in his magic, nature and wanted to learn about them. From then until she was about nine, she learned about nature, religion, history, and the languages sylvan and druidic from books and the druid Arien Londe.
She gained most of her knowledge from books  and the druid’s viewpoint on things along with her parents.
Her siblings had grown up and left to take off on their own but her sister, Chann hung around for Felan’s company
When she was around 15-20 years old she studied more, gained curiosity about humans, and the world that they lived in
She started learning common from books
She asked the druid more about the world….. But he tends to ignore or talk his way around things. However! He would show Felan mundane items from the world and tell her about them as much as he could. When Arien finally noticed how enamored she was with traveling and what she had read from books, he decided to let her do as she wished and travel. But before she went, she received a traveling blessing from him along with tattoos for protection.
She left and roamed the woods with her sister for a few months and made a couple of wolf friends named Tala (female regular timberwolf) and Rost (male with reddish tint in his fur).
After she was comfortable with traveling (she’s around 21), she finally decided that she was ready to enter the world of humans and left her sister and her friends in the woods.. A few weeks later, the joined the caravan that was heading to Caroe because of the free transportation!

		<p><b>Fish Falone:</b><br />From birth Fish was regarded with fear and contempt; blamed by her mother for her father leaving. Fish would often steal away to the monestary. There the monks taught her to harness the ebb and flow of of the bodies energy and protected her when they could. Though more often then not her mother would drag her back "home". One day during a ritual beating Fish lost control, using her powers to scold her mother. The monks knowing that Fish would be punished sent her away on a merchant's ship, equipped with a book "that would reveal itself in time", a traditional weapon of the monks and a prayer of protection to Celestian. Once on the sea Fish fell in love with the ocean, staying and working on the ship as it traveled. Now she has decided it's time to explore beyond the sea and try to find answers to the mysterious book she carries.</p>

		<p><b>Flyn:</b><br />Filtar T’yn grew up in the drow city of Zwei where he lived the dangerous and difficult life of a drow. Coming from a decent drow matriarch was given teachings in many ways of drow society like all the ways that one could easily hide a body or all the ways to kill a human. As he grew up he took quite the interests in tinkering where he joined Zwei’s local artisan guild under head tinkerer Zarle T'sar one of the more violent female drow Flynn has ever met and had to work around. Here he learned the ways of a tinker and began honing his craft creating many questionable devices for member of the drow matriarchy. 
He worked here a number of years and hated everything he was tasked with making. It was a very miserable life when your creativity is shunted so you can appease task master guild owners and the powerful matriarchy.
Filtar like most drow had very few friends. The one that he did have lead a rather strange life always talking about better places than the city. Her name was Sasrith Filyn and she was rather odd compared to most drow. While the other drow were constantly pulling, she was much calmer and nicer than most other drow. The two had meet while Filtar was working at the guild. Were she took a rather odd interest in him after he wound up making a holy gear. Filtar later learned that she was a member of Zwei’s temple of eleistree drow goddess of moonlight dance and swordsmanship were she invited him to join them. Rather skeptical Filtar accepted as it was unheard of for a male drow to poses these abilities and be accepted for it by a temple. Shortly after being allowed in and accepted by the fellow priests (took about a week) he was almost assassinated by another drow.
The temple hearing of this from filtar took this oddly seriously. And sent him and Sasrith on a trip to the surface with 2 goals of which Flynn only knew of 1 to spread eleistree grace across the surface and the one only Sasrith knew of. Many days went by as they wandered the depth of the darkness until they reached a small opening were a ray of silver light shone through. It is here where Filtar sees the moon for the first time. Never had he thought that he would see something so magnificent.
Months go by as the two wandered as Sasrith made every effort to explain as much as she could about the surface world and the many inhabitants that called it home. Flynn was feeling rather hopeful as they made their way into the town of Acton. It is however here were things go straight to hell. The two were in the town no longer than 30 minutes before a mob has both formed and surrounded them.
Sasrith made every effort to calm and pacify the mob but these attempts fell short on every account. Next thing they knew a fight had broken out. Sasrith is immediately jumped with filtar dropping seconds’ prior with his last sight being arrows going out the front of his through and friend being stabbed by numerous individuals.
Filtar later regaining consciousness outside of town under a tree in the dead of night. In great pain and with very little energy he made his way back to the towns gate where he saw Sasrith Mutilated and strung up on a board for all to see. Filtar was now in a world that wanted him dead with the only person who cared to help him dead. filtar collapses at the sight of this.
How could he believe any of the things he was told in the temple and by his friend after he sees this.   In doubt filtar gets up cuts down his friend and carries her mutilated corpse out to the woods where he started making a funeral pyre. With each step, he lost more and more faith. How could this be what our kind deserve? What does she know that we don’t? what could it be? These questions kept enough of the metaphorical flame burning. Why am I still here? He finishes the pyre and lights it says a prayer for his friend and set off.
Being low on funds and food filtar makes travels alone searching for any way he can to survive. Whatever it that may be. </p>

		<p><b>Issacar Haddnot:</b><br />“So, why do you fight?”
Issachar didn’t turn to face Magnus-Sarii Florentine right away after he asked this question. They had both been on this ship for at least three months now. Formal and even casual greetings were starting to be omitted from conversation. Every discussion began from whatever mood they were both in when they last spoke. It ended only when neither had much else to say or needed to take care of bodily functions. As the ship rocked back and forth, so too did Issachar’s mind. Magnus had been curious enough and Issachar felt that he should know the answer. Yet like with all things he weighed on it and waited before speaking. This process only took a few moments, but it was vital for him to take this time. Even from birth Issachar was even tempered and measured with speech. “Why do I fight?”, he thought as the waves began to rise once more. 
“Do you fight for your own satisfaction?”, asks Fermata de Elfary as an arrow shoots passed Issachar’s ear. He is eight years old now. His small lungs do not sustain enough breath for both a witty response and the energy to dodge the volley of arrows coming towards him. Fermata was was not completely displaying his mastery of elven archery. Issachar would be dead outright if he had done that. No. Fermata restrained himself to showing only the capabilities of a normal archer. This amount of effort was plenty enough to punch holes in Issachar if he was not constantly dodging as he made his advance towards his teacher.  “If indeed so” Fermata continued “You cannot ever hope to be satisfied by this performance.” There was some truth to this. Issachar had already been hit in the left shoulder. Red blood dripping down his arm to his sword bearing hand. His body spoke for him then. Every sidestep a defiance against the tauntings of his instructor. Fermata as a high elven knight seemed more at peace with history and rhetoric teachings rather than combat. That is until he picked up his bow and sword. Then the same eloquence with which he spoke shot forth through his bow and likewise with his swing of his sword, but today was the day Issachar would succeed. He already spotted an opening. He leaped over, rolled and drew his short sword in melee and clashed swords with … Odi. 
Odi was the eldest son of the emperor's right hand. A more slender man than Issachar and more elusive. Issachar is nineteen. On the cusp of manhood and of death. He glances over at the young princess Imani as he steps backward. They love each other deeply, but their secret courtship has no precedence over an arranged marriage. Odi doesn’t have to turn back to see her reaction. The fact that this man is looking at his wife to be infuriates him enough. Issachar turns back to Odi. Odi charges him. Issachar didn’t step back far enough. Issachar catches the last glimpse of the strike that will cost him his right eye and the fight. In a fortnight, he will wake up in an unmarked temple, an empty book tucked under his arm, his right eye restored and the iris green. In a month, Odi and Imani will be married. 
“Get up.” commanded Logath. Issachar arose to find a large azure dragonborn towering over him. “Unless you’re dead you have no excuse.” Issachar was still in shock, his right arm broken. So much for bearing a shield in this fight. He releases his grip on that bronze circular shield and gives himself a small distance before facing his instructor again. Logath was a harsh and merciless instructor. The kind that would even use his breath weapon on a teenager. “Don’t you fight for your family?” These words stung Issachar more than the electricity still coursing through his muscles. He had a great loyalty for his family name. As a small child, he was in attendance when his father was given the surname Haddnot and to the surprise of the other council men a seat in his court. The name Haddnot was a gift from the Emperor Ardashir to his father Cobja and his descendants forever. Issachar narrowed his vision. He would not fail his name. Not now not ever. This is why years later he would volunteer to accompany the paranormal hunters that Magnus came with. Not only to find an ally within the seventh council seat, but a success in this quest would bring honor to that precious name. Logath bestowed upon Issachar, several mental and physical training rituals that he would carry with him the rest of his life. He also learned how to read people. A dragonborn's face to most seems expressionless. Yet after years of study. Issachar began to understand him emotionally and gain respect for him. Logath was unforgiving, but so was the reality of battle. 
Gad and Asher, Issachar’s elder brothers, knew this all too well. A rebellion cropped up in one of the desert cities of Soldra. The Amethyst seat, the house of the Haddnot, was ordered by the right hand to deal with the situation. Gad, a general of moderate sized force, and Asher a captain of a battalion of cavalry men was more than enough for the situation. Still, Issachar performed admirably and even laid the head of the rebel leader at the feet of the emperor. This helped to solidify his family’s place in court and the memory of the emperor. So when the remnants of the previous rebellion captured the walled city of Nesher. The three sons of Cobja were called again to lay siege. Gad slayed the leader of the new; Asher slayed the second, third and fourth in command, but Issachar was said to be the first atop the city walls. He himself reraised the emperor's banner. 
“Ya damn right you fight for your nation.” said burped Mordecai Ironheart. The dwarven champion of Lodruica was now more of an old friend than a tutor. Training with him was always over by sundown, for he strongly believed that the evenings were for drinking rather than fighting. Issachar never had a taste for ale until he began tutoring with Mordecai and quickly learned that attempts of persuasion went alot smoother with ale, wine or gin around. “Thank you teacher. You honor me far more than I could ever deserve.”  Issachar replied in fluent dwarvish.  “Ya only flaw is that ya too damn polite!” shouted Mordecai. It was often said that every dwarf sojourning in the nation of Soldra can be found in one of its various tavern’s and wineries. When questioned about this stereotype, Mordecai replied, “It ain't’ no pigeon hole if it’s true.” Training with Mordecai wasn’t wasn’t all fun and games. Logath’s training laid the foundation of Issachar’s athletics, but Mordecai’s nearly perfected it. All it cost was a few broken ribs suffered at the end of a warhammer. This warhammer, appropriately named bonebreaker in dwarvish, was given as gift to Issachar when his training  with Mordecai was complete at the age of twenty-two. Mordecai’s reasoning was that since the hammer had contacted Issachar’s blood and bones so often that it was practically a part of him now. 
These gifts were small trinkets compared to the inheritance Gad would receive. As is tradition in soldra the eldest son receives all of the material possessions of the father, but Gad was not puffed up because of this, unlike many other eldest sons. Asher too would be gaining a household of his own. The household of the emperor's left hand was without sons, so they adopted Asher since he proved himself to be a capable man. Issachar and his younger brother Zebulun would have to make their own way in the world or form lesser households subservient to the house of Gad. The latter is not a bad option. As part of a lesser household, Issachar could live comfortably as a courtier only venturing off to battle as the time needed. Gad admonished Issachar against doing this, saying “No. You too must also be great.” There is a saying in Soldra that the task always follows the purpose. Gad provided the motivation and later Cobja would provide the task: the removal of all fiendish influence throughout the realms. This would be the catalyst that sends him on a journey across the world.
	Fighting was not a daily part of Issachar’s life in Soldra. It was more of the exception rather than the rule. Most of his days, he spent reading the various historical records of the massive library stored at the capitol, reading and reciting both poetry and proverbs, professing promises and passions with Imani, before she became engaged, and training in both the languages and fighting styles of his tutors. Issachar chose to fight. He felt that fighting expressed his true self more than through words and art. Battle to him was the true expression of the souls of men, beasts, and all other creatures. He chose to be a warrior since he felt that he could no longer be counted as a lover.
Issachar did not express this romantic sentiment to his traveling companion. Those were not the right words to use to answer his question. Issachar chose the following : “ I fight to fulfill my responsibility to my nation, my family and …” he turns around to face Magnus .my friends.”

		<p><b>Magnisari Rassi:</b><br />Growing up in a small village by the name of Rorin, on the outskirts of Norrheim’s lands, life was something fairly simple and easy living for a farming community. Fertile land, sprawling fields of golden wheat and orchards that team with apple trees. Very peaceful, not the life a hunter is typically born from, but it is said they come from all walks of life. 
As said, life was fairly simple and peaceful, the occasional bandit attack keeping the village and its miniscule militia on its toes. Magnus himself, as a given, was a farmhand for some time during his youth, working on his parent’s farm, tending to the orchards they owned, a childhood of climbing into trees and carrying baskets of the delicious fruits. Of course, being the wonderful parents that they were, they always told Magnus various stories of exceptional individuals. . . Ranging from heroes to those who simply came along, doing what needed to be done, regardless of the norms and rules established. The Hunters, men and women of exceptional skill and wit that hunt and slaughter even the most fearsome of beasts. Known for their incredible bravery and odd look, Magnus was infatuated with them after hearing the first tales of their deeds, and from that point aspired to become one himself. 
Using what was around him, farm-labor and work took on a new meaning and purpose for the young Magnus, being more than just a means of earning a small amount of coin from his parents to spend at the tavern, but as a means to build endurance, muscle, stamina, just a means of becoming more physically fit and capable to meet the demands of a Hunter’s lifestyle that he’d gained a glimpse into from the tales he’d been told. At a point, he even wound up joining the village militia for a time, desiring to learn the basics of the various swords and other weapons the town had collected over the years to defend itself with, most of it being things they picked up from bandits they’d protected themselves from, not to mention what the Crusaders of Norrheim were willing to show them as well, teaching the village militia how to be ferocious combatants when defending their home. Magnus though, he took those lessons with the soldiers to heart, despite not looking to become a Crusader himself, such teachings were more than useful from the aspiring young lad, so that combined with being able to use a bit of everything under the sun in terms of instruments of war, Magnus, by adulthood was a pretty well rounded individual in the area of combat, finding a particular fondness for the more dexterous sorts of weapons that he could dance with, either around or against his opponent, weapons that wouldn’t weigh him down and were well-balanced.
There of course came the time when Magnus came of age to leave home, pursue his own life and make his own way. . . And by now, most of the village knew full well his intentions, many rooted for him, but many also warned against it, many of the tales that surrounded The Hunters eventually leading to one of their ultimate demise at the hands of some creature, or succumbing to some madness. It basically hardly ever ended well, the concerns over it made vocal, but being set on his own goal, Magnus set out. With a fairly cheap set of leather on his person, a long-sword on his hip, and pack slung over his shoulder with some homemade rations, he was off into the wilds. He wasn’t actually sure what he was supposed to do to officially join The Hunters, if there was some office he was supposed to go to, or something of that nature. . . But without the knowledge, he went off his impulsive nature and gut instinct, and began his own series of hunts. He worked to get silvered weaponry, at least for when the job called for it since it often did, where he’d hunt down various sorts of were-creatures, putting them to a ruthless slaughter, a merciless hunt that often left the pre-hunter Magnus weary and battered, but also reeking with blood and death. A scent that while rather distasteful, he found it worked well against the creatures he went after for some reason, that the scent that surrounded him after multiple hunts seemed to upset them, put them off balance for some odd reason. Couldn’t figure out why, but not using that piece of knowledge to his advantage would put him at a disadvantage, and thinking he’d been clever in figuring this out as well, he thought it’d be something that would shine if The Hunters were to actually be watching him. . . Little did he know how common of a practice that this was.
Years passed, the once aged eighteen Magnus now in his early-twenties. . . His hunts unending and unyielding, despite the near-death encounters, how blind luck had saved him countless times, the scars he had to show for it. It inevitably paid off though, a single night bringing forth the change that Magnus had sought, coming like a wind that blew upon him one evening, as he laid his head to rest at an inn. He never felt the presence, nor did he notice it at first the next morning. . . But a package had been left for him, one that sat in the center of the room. A wooden box, a fair size, a parcel. He was cautious after noticing its presence, gazing about the room, weapon readied as he checked the room, only to find the only thing that was out of place was this box. His curiosity inevitably getting the better of him, Magnus opened it, a slight creak from the hinges, the scent of leather and gunpowder filling the air, as well as a very foreboding sense, dread and fear. . . The stench of death, more potent than what Magnus had ever coated himself in. Within, there was several things, all of it what he had hoped for. . . First, in the very top. . . A note, sealed with blood-red wax stamp, a pistol and sabre crossing, The Hunters’ symbol, simple, but one that struck fear in even some of the bravest, their presence often marking a hunt, either for many things or a single truly dangerous entity. The surprise of it all was almost palpable, as if the intensity in the air could be grabbed and used as a weapon itself. The seal on the note, the scent within this box, beneath the letter he now held in his hand, a long, dark coat. . . A pistol, a trinket of sorts? One in similar design to how the seal looked, a sort of pin that could be fashioned to the coat. 
Pulling apart the note, it read: 
May your slaughters be many. 
May your life be long-lived.
Welcome, Hunter.
Gehrman, The Reaper
So, this was it. His initiation into the Hunters, the trials he put himself through. . . Rewarded by an unknown visitor in the night that left him this parcel to be found, within the tools of the trade he was now a part of. Strapping the various belts and holsters to himself before donning the coat, Magnus had a look at the pistol, this strange contraption. . . A set of instruction on loading and firing the thing, tools to craft ammo, perhaps even other weapons if he was so inclined. . . Would be a lot of learning, but it’d be worth it, he was sure of that. 
Moving forward a couple of years, things picked up once more for two reasons really. . . Seeing as Magnus never did really stop hunting, just now it was done in a more official sense, where he’d be hailed into places to see if he could handle a creature that’s been stalking the night. . . This was something different. Apparently, some unearthly, very unsettling beastie had taken up residence in a ruin, somewhere in Ablon’s dominion. . . Well, the guards weren’t able to handle it, and being a hunter, this was up Magnus’ alley as it stood, so he set out on his journey. To this day however, he feels the celestial bodies must’ve aligned or something, that or it was fate for some reason or another toying with him, because this ruin. . . It felt off, more off than even the usual ruin, unnatural. Perhaps it was the beast that had taken up residence within? He wasn’t sure. He continued with caution, seeing as there being a beast in here was all he knew, but instead of finding it straight away, he found a book. Yes, indeed, a book. Large, bound by a strange leather, a lantern next to it that when ignited emitted an almost ominous, never fading green glow. . . Deciding to keep that as a memento, and as something useful, Magnus set that aside and opened to book, a strange curiosity having grown the longer he was in its presence. Well, he remembers opening it. . . Then he remember waking up on the floor, visions and voices in his head, odd creatures, knowledge of things unspoken off, his head aching, feeling as if it were splitting open, like his eyes were going to drop out of his skull. . . Given how he felt, and because he associated it with book, he quickly lit a torch, scattered some of the rotting cloth on the ground, using parchment for further tinder, then lit the book aflame on it, destroying the damn thing. . . Though the damage had already been done, it still felt like a small victory of sorts. 
The next largest ordeal he encountered was when a hunt was called by the order itself. A city within the borders of Opriera by the name of Soras had fallen to a taint most foul and destructive, leaving the residents of it twisted creatures, survivors far and few between, and those who didn’t find themselves afflicted nor surviving, rended asunder by the claws of beast and monstrosity. Blood painted the streets of the once beautiful city a deep crimson, the same being said for the interior of many different places, many of the walls not spared a drop of blood, shattered glass, broken windows and furniture. . . Nothing but destruction as far as the eye could see. It was Magnus and a few other Hunters’ jobs to not only clear the city, but to disinfect it, which meant the burning of the dead in massive pyres, plumes of billowing smoke brought the ashes of the dead into the sky, then rained it back down on their heads like snow. . . Death above and below. Of course, there was a fair amount of rest that was taken, days spent fighting left even the most extraordinary weary. . . And the ferocity of it all led many Hunters to even pair up in groups, feeling it would be safer. Magnus actually found himself with a woman about his age, a sorceress by the name of Adale Silvermane, a partnership of survival between a Wild Mage and Fighter. Needless to say, they went well together, their own styles of fighting complimenting one another, Magnus being the louder sort attracted most attention from her, allowing her to throw her magic at almost anything on the field, uninterrupted, which by extension kept an excess of creatures from piling up on Magnus. Each fight usually ending with them victorious, maybe a few scratches, and plenty of bodies to be burned, a time to rest, time for the two to sit and talk. . . Get to know one another, this time they spent with one another building a bond that would inevitably go further than mere friendship, and cross into the romantic, at least as romantic as being stuck in a tainted city could get. . . Find a good enough spot that’s high up and away from the hellish things beneath them, there’s a way of doing it. Regardless of all of that, the hunt itself did eventually come to a close, once the final body was accounted for, the last beast slaughtered and burned at the feet of those who worked up to this point, many of them having built bonds that they carried for long after they departed from the wretched place, leaving Opriera to clean the rest of the mess, as that wasn’t their job. 
Being a pair of hunters though, Magnus and Adale weren’t able to see each other all too often, unfortunate but expected from the two. They had work to do, most of which called one, the other, or both of them to far corners of the world to see the task was done, but they relished in the short time they were able to spend together, Adale being one of the few that drowned the voices that now whispered in Magnus’ head at bay, a fact that she took pride in, namely that she held more power than whatever beast that had decided to infest her man’s mind. It has however been some time since he’s seen his love, the last letter he’d received being dated back a month prior, saying that all was still well, that the hunt was still on, and that they’d see eachother again someday, but to keep focused, and to try and figure out what’s in his head so they could go and slaughter it together.
Recently as well was a new relationship that was formed, a friendship and bond of brotherhood between Magnus himself and a noble’s son of Saldra, Issachar. They’d been paired up for work, a simple job that took them out of the city, and into the wastes, hunting for a necromancer that had been raising an army of the dead, a contingent of younger hunters and Saldraian soldiers accompanying them for what was sure to be a battle, nothing like what Magnus hadn’t already seen in the past, but it was arguably nice to be fighting alongside someone that knew what he was actually doing, and once the job was done, the two found themselves to be fast friends, even going as far as swearing an oath of sorts that was brought up by Issachar to Magnus. Simple, that they’d watch eachother’s backs, keep eachother alive, as Issachar was to leave with Magnus from the island nation, a reason that Magnus assumed had to do with being the later of several brothers, basically leaving him from the inheritance of the family, so he’d have to carve his own way as a result. . . And who better to travel with than one of those you had already fought alongside, and trusted?
Their adventure beginning, a hunt for the largest creature Magnus feels he’ll ever face, and for Issachar, a hunt for a fortune that eluded him. . . A boat ride that would take them three months before they’d find themselves on the mainland. Now it was just a matter of who’d they find accompanying them both next.

		<p><b>Taquis Lillin Trina Helwyn Isolys Rubyrune:</b><br />Taquis's birth was just like any other birth, natural, it was what came after that wasn't natural. After her birth at the ripe age of 4 taquis was sold off to a man by her parents so that the y could sustain themselves on the drink that they were desperately addicted to. This man took Taquis in to his family treating her like a child become queen. Taquis hadn't known her parents for too long so she though this was normal. So for most of her younger years she was pamper, given gifts and fed whatever she wanted when she wanted it. This is how her life went until she turned 20 her "adopted father" and some of her other "family" came to her room at the dawn of the day and shoved her in a large sack. After many hours of struggleing Taquis was finally released by her "family" into a series of caves and was told she was to be the families once a decade sacrifice to their god and patron Juiblex. And that the slimes that lived here would feed upon her fat until Juiblex was satisfied. Taquis confused and terrified after her "family" told her this ran deep into the cave to find a way out and away from them and the slimes that were soon to come. After mere minutes due to her size at the time she could no longer run. With the slimes closing in to devour her she started to cry. After a few minutes though she heard a new sound coming over the sound of the slimes pusuit of her. It was music, soft and gentle at some moments and then deep and wrathful at others. Ad she went to see what it was she saw an elven man with a lute made of beautiful wood and a group of people with him doing battle with the slimes, and while they were outnumber they were victorious in the end. After the battle had subsided Taquis new one thing at that moment she wanted to be like them, brave and never out of wits when the going got tough so she approched them and after much deliberation amoungst the group they agreed to take under their wing and teach her what ever they could. They taught her magic, music, acrobatics and athleticism, and so much more but music and magic were her favorites. And her two favorites in the party taught her well, Rennyn Lorassis the elf that she first saw that day in the cave and his friend Sena Heryara a wizard. And after many years of learning and travel and adventure with them and their group she decided it was time to depart on her own to make her own group. Given a spell book and Rennyn's iron wood lute as gifts she set too work at the Devil's spirit adventuring guild in Kerube to start her journey. Little did she know that one day she would be embroiled in the adventures of true legends.</p>

		<p><b>Virgil Weatherbee:</b><br />Virgil was born and raised in the town of Ambertown. His father was a beet farmer and since a young age Virgil has been working the fields with him. While he understood that he had to help and enjoyed the hard work he was more interested in helping his mother with her flower gardens. Over the years he became a fan of the insects and birds that would flourish around them. He has three younger sisters. Velanna, Verna, and Violet. Being the oldest he of course has had to assist in looking out for them, so he has become very close with his siblings. His position in the family as the only male son Virgil always felt as if it was his duty to become something more than the average farmer. He wanted to go out into the world to make a name for himself and become something that his family could be proud of. His father was apprehensive of him leaving, but his mother had always told her children that they can achieve their goals and set forth on anything they wish to achieve. After long and careful thought, he decided that leaving his home and setting out to become of Paladin of the God Heironeous was the best fit for him. At the age of 30 he set foot on his journey to Norheim, the religious capital.
	This is where Virgil trained for many years, learning the blade, mesmerizing scriptures, and learning what it truly meant to be a paladin of devotion. It was some time before he actually took on the Oath for he wanted to be sure he was fully prepared and appropriate for what he was devoting his life too. He did not have much faith in himself but in reality he was the true definition of what it meant to be a noble paladin. He was honest, compassionate, and seeked to end all chaos and assist those in dire need. An elder paladin by the name of Yadduth Leadjaw acted as a mentor of some sorts to Virgil, teaching him what he knew and passing down his knowledge. He soon became a father like figure to Virgil. And for Yadduth, Virgil was the son he never had. 
	Everything was going well for Virgil. This was the life he had dreamed of for so long and he finally believed he had found his purpose in life. It was until while assisting the guards with local lawbreakers, after everything had been settled and the evil doers captured, Yadduth had collapsed on the spot. Virgil was sent into a panic, there was no wounds or attackers and no possible way that he had fallen ill. There was nothing he could do and in his last moments Yadduth told him to become a more righteous man than he was, and then died in Virgil’s arms. 
	Yadduth was a very, very old dwarf so while it was a surprise, everyone knew that it was just his time to go. Virgil continued to blame himself, believing that there was something he could have done. Even though he had spent the past 4 years of his life here, this was when Virgil decided it was time to go off on his own. He could not let any of his paladin brother and sisters down again and thought it would be best to travel, assisting those who need it but never staying in one place for too long. He left with the few belongings he had, including a brooch given to him by Yadduth and set foot again hoping to find a new chapter in his life. 
	He traveled around the realm for a year helping whomever he could, never taking payment of any kind. He would always be on the move, never staying with the same people or getting too attached to those he met. This was until on his journey he came across a cart getting rampaged by bandits. Being the man he is, he stepped in to defeat them. He discovered the owner of the cart was Genevieve Montga, a Cleric of Avandra, seeking to heal and care for the weary travelers of the world. She thanked him for his bravery and kind heart and asked him for anyway that she could repay his kindness. Seeing that her driver had run off during the fight, he knew he could not just leave her on her own, so he asked that she would allow him to accompany her on her journey for some time, until he knew she would be safe.
 What he thought would be a short journey turned into his daily life for the next few years. Traveling was something he was doing anyways but now he had companionship. They would help with the sick and the unfortunate as much as they could. Soon the two would become very close friends, and that friendship then bloomed into romance. For Virgil, Genevieve was the one who allowed him to relax. In her eyes he wasn’t just Virgil the farm boy or Virgil the Mighty Paladin. He was just Virgil, she loved every aspect of him from the way he protected the weak to how on long quiet travels he would teach her all kinds of bird calls. The two fit together perfectly. 
They traveled to Lenos, the home of her father, in hopes of having him give his blessing on the union. Virgil was happy that his answer was yes, but there still had been something bothering him. He did truly care about her, but he sometimes felt that his feelings for her were not what people would call true love. Sometimes he felt that if she had just been a man instead, he would feel different. This was a scary thought that Virgil had. He was the only son, the one meant to carry on the family name. He couldn’t have feelings for men.
It wasn’t until the night before the wedding that Virgil had decided that even if he had not come to terms with his own sexuality yet, he could not marry Genevieve. It would not be fair to her or himself. So in the night he wrote her a letter, telling her how deeply truly sorry he is for wasting her time and causing the pain she was going to feel but it was what had to be done. He left with many regrets. He will still say that to this day she is one of the closest and most important people he had ever met, but he knows that if they were ever to meet again it would not be the same. 
After leaving her he went off again, still seeking a new purpose to his life. And after dealing with an attack on a town, being saved by a group of strangers, and defeating a new evil with them, he believes that he may have found what he has been looking for…
